## Git common commands for when...

You want to download a new repo for the first time:

```
git clone https://url-copied-from-website
```


You're starting work for the day on a shared project and you aren't sure if others have checked in recently. You should

```
git pull
```

You're trying to remember if you are up to date or not, or what is ready to upload.

```
git status
```

You got a new feature working or a bug fixed. It is time to check that in.

```
git status
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push
```

**The last command will show you another command you'll need to copy/paste/run**

After checking in, your github manager will need to do the merge on the website.

---
If you're on your own repo and have no other collaborators and you just want to check in the quick-and-easy way:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message here"
git push
```
